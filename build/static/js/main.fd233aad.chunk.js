As the brightest natural object in Earth\'s night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus"},"structure":{"content":"The similarity in size and density between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, Venusian core is most likely at least partially liquid because the two planets have been cooling at about the same rate.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus#Internal_structure"},"geology":{"content":"Much of the Venusian surface appears to have been shaped by volcanic activity.

Earth\'s distance from the Sun, physical properties and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"},"structure":{"content":"Earth\'s interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#Internal_structure"},"geology":{"content":"The total surface area of Earth is about 510 million km2.

In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\".","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars"},"structure":{"content":"Like Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid by less dense materials. Scientists initially determined that the core is at least partially liquid. Current models of its interior imply a core consisting primarily of iron and nickel with about 16\u201317% sulfur.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars#Internal_structure"},"geology":{"content":"Mars is a terrestrial planet whose surface consists of minerals containing silicon and oxygen, metals, and other elements that typically make up rock.

A possible cause is an impact from a planet of about ten Earth masses a few million years after Jupiter\'s formation, which would have disrupted an originally solid Jovian core.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter#Internal_structure"},"geology":{"content":"The best known feature of Jupiter is the Great Red Spot, a persistent anticyclonic storm located 22\xb0 south of the equator.

It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn"},"structure":{"content":"Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn\'s mass is not in the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01 g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn\'s mass.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn#Internal_structure"},"geology":{"content":"The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume.

It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus"},"structure":{"content":"The standard model of Uranus\'s structure is that it consists of three layers: a rocky (silicate/iron\u2013nickel) core in the centre, an icy mantle in the middle and an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium envelope. The core is relatively small, with a mass of only 0.55 Earth masses.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus#Internal_structure"},"geology":{"content":"The composition of Uranus\'s atmosphere is different from its bulk, consisting mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium.

It is 17 times the mass of Earth, more massive than its near-twin Uranus.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune"},"structure":{"content":"Neptune\'s internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5% to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10% to 20% of the way towards the core. Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the lower regions.","source":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune#Internal_structure"},"geology":{"content":"Neptune\'s atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium.
